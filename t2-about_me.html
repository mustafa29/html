        <p>
            I'm a <i>graduate </i> of Harvard College and have an MBA from the Sloan School at MIT. My business career spanned
            software development, management consulting, and training. My <strong>favorite job was writing</strong> and
            summarizing content for internal websites for a Fortune 500 company.
        </p>

        <p>
            Throughout my career I found that clear, concise writing was essential to success. Whether writing a
            business proposal that sells, a case study that generates sales leads, or a document summary that saves a
            high-priced consultant some time, the connection between content and profit has always been clear.
        </p>

        <p>
            In <mark> 2011, I launched my own business </mark> to combine my love of creating content with a focus on greener
            businesses and organizations. By “greener” I don’t mean that all my clients are like Whole Foods or Seventh
            Generation. But according to a study by KPMG, some 93% of the world’s largest companies conduct green
            initiatives and report on them.
        </p>

        <p>
            I work with organizations that have begun their journey towards more sustainable practices, to help amplify
            and celebrate those efforts. And I “walk the talk.” In 2012 I received Platinum Certification from the Green
            Business Bureau. In 2013 I earned “Bronze” status from Green America.
